(Yet Another Asterisk Manager)

This is a web interface that i wrote to “manage” my Asterisk server. It is not meant at all to be an alternative to FreePbx and the like. It has very basic functionality : A call log viewer, voicemail manager, system log viewer and a few tools. You can’t add voicemail boxes, user extensions or modify the dialplan with this interface. It has a plugin system, so you can add or remove features you don’t need.
